      <p>
        <strong>Software engineer</strong>, passionate about math, physics,
        technology and science in general.

        I'm a <strong>true polyglot</strong> when it's about coding and I usually
        don't like spending my time argumenting which language is better as I
        would rather spend it learning a new one. This doesn't mean that I don't
        have opinions: I do have <strong>strong opinions</strong> on tools and practices in general
        and I like discussing about them as this is to me the way forward to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a past characterized by some Java, C# and lots of PHP/Symfony development
        I recently begun moving toward functional programming with <strong>Scala</strong>
        and considering the possibility to learn also some Haskell to improve my
        understanding of the functional word. I also begun hanging out at the
        London Scala User Group events where I enjoy hacking with some amazing people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live in London and I spend my time off between good food, parks, books,
        movies and anything that will attract my (eager) <strong>curiosity</strong>.
